- Describe your thoughts about your code.
I tried to write code with performance in mind. Everything is pre-rendered and heavily cached.
In terms of code organization, I added small and reusable components for assembling a blog post.

- Which libraries did you use and why.
I used tailwind as it's a really common tool for writing styles. It helped a lot as I added a few constants for colors or sizes in order to match the designs.

- What did you enjoy about the challenge? What are you proud of?
This challenge lets the developer unleash his creativity in terms of how to structure the components and the logic. I am proud of a utility function that I made, which estimates the time needed to read a post based on the number of words it has. I think such function could also be used in a real blog platform.

- What was not so great?
A few things were not working out of the box for this challenge. For example Jest and Eslint had to be configured again which was a bit frustrating.

- How would you improve it if you had more time?
I would configure tailwind even more to the point of having a proper design system with the correct colors, sizes, etc... Also I would try adding more unit tests to improve the overall code coverage.
